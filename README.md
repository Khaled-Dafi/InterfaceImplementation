# InterfaceImplementation
A C# example demonstrating interfaces and class implementations. Check out how classes Khaled, Mesheal, and Naif adhere to the Ibest and Ibetter interfaces in the Test.cs file. ðŸš€


What is an interface: An interface defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface. 
An interface may define a default implementation for members. It may also define static members in order to provide a single implementation for common functionality. 
Beginning with C# 11, an interface may define static abstract or static virtual members to declare that an implementing type must provide the declared members. 
Typically, static virtual methods declare that an implementation must define a set of overloaded operators.
what is the difference between interface and inheritance c#?

Inheritance: It's like a parent passing traits to their child. A class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

Interface: It's like a contract. A class can promise to have certain methods or properties without inheriting everything from another class.

how about the Abstraction?

Inheritance: Sharing everything between parent and child.

Interface: Promising to have certain things, but not sharing everything.

Abstraction: Using something without needing to understand its internal details.
